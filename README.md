# cogitator

Throwaway POC: a TUI command centre that gives a **live** multi-session view of
locally-running [opencode](https://opencode.ai) instances and triages sessions
that need attention (pending permission requests, pending questions, and
errors), while separating
active work from inactive context.

**Status:** proof of concept. macOS only. Read-only; no controls. Don't ship.

## Prerequisite

Each opencode instance you want to monitor must be launched with `--mdns` so
it advertises itself on `_http._tcp.local.`:

```sh
opencode --mdns                       # default port (random)
opencode serve --mdns --port 7777     # headless, fixed port
```

You can launch as many as you like; cogitator discovers them automatically.

## Run

```sh
go run ./cmd/cogitator
```

`q`, `Esc`, or `Ctrl+C` quits. A debug log is written to
`/tmp/cogitator.log`.

## What you'll see

One pane:

- **Sessions**: grouped by instance (separated by blank lines, no host/port labels).
  - **Live** rows (bright): observed via SSE during this cogitator run.
    `active` means the session is currently doing work (`busy`/`generating`).
    Non-busy top-level sessions render as `inactive`.
    Subagents nest under their parent with `↳` and an `@agent-name` tag.
    Finished subagents (`idle`/empty status) are hidden unless they have a
    pending permission request, pending question, or an unresolved error.
    Each root row shows the session's working directory dim-suffixed
    after the title (e.g. `Fix flaky test  ~/src/foo`); paths under
    `$HOME` are abbreviated to `~`. Subagent rows omit the directory
    since they inherit their parent's cwd.
    Live rows are sorted by initiation time (oldest first), so rows
    don't dance around on every message tick. Sessions needing user
    action (pending permission, pending question, unresolved error)
    pin to the top of the live block; everything else holds its slot
    once initiation times resolve.
  - **Recent** rows (dim, italic `recent` label): pulled from each instance's
    project session list, filtered to those updated in the last 30 minutes.
    Promoted to "live" the moment any event arrives for them.

## How it works

For each discovered instance cogitator:

1. Subscribes to `GET /global/event` (NOT `GET /event`, which is silently
   scoped to the requesting client's directory).
2. Polls `GET /permission` every 5s so a permission raised before the
   cogitator connected still surfaces.
3. Polls `GET /session` every 30s and keeps rows whose `time.updated` falls
   within the last 30 minutes — discovery for sessions you were already
   working on before cogitator started.
4. Asynchronously fetches `GET /session/{id}` the first time it sees an
   unfamiliar session ID, just to populate title/slug/agent for display.

## What you can't see, and why

opencode does **not** expose "which session is currently open in this TUI".
The `/tui/*` endpoints are *control* (tell a TUI to do something), not state
queries. The TUI process owns its current selection internally and never
broadcasts it. So the closest proxy is **recency** — sessions touched in the
last N minutes are the ones you're likely working on. That's what the recent
import shows.

opencode also shares **one database across all running processes**:

- `GET /global/event` echoes every event to every connected process.
- `GET /experimental/session` returns the same global list to every process.
- `GET /session` is project-scoped to the requesting process's working
  directory, which is why we use it for recency import — it gives natural
  per-instance scoping when your opencode instances are in different cwds.

If you have two opencode instances started in the **same** cwd, you'll see
their session lists overlap. That's a faithful reflection of opencode's
model, not a bug.

## Lifecycle

When an instance disappears (process killed, mDNS announce gone) its sessions
are silently dropped. When it comes back, the next mDNS browse pass re-adds
it and the recency import refills its rows.

## Why throwaway

The goal is to validate the pipeline (mDNS → `/global/event` + `/session`
recency → classifier → TUI) and the sessions-focused UX. A real version would
replace the ad-hoc HTTP types with a generated client, add interactivity
(approve permissions, jump into a session), and likely surface opencode's
TUI-current-session out of band (a small opencode plugin could broadcast
selection events on `tui.session.select` via `/global/event`, eliminating
the recency proxy).
